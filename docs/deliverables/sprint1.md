# Deliverables - 1st sprint

## Shape
* **Only** 1 .pdf
* With a summary
* Drop it on Moodle

## Deadline
**Thursday 20/10/2016**

## Items

### 1. Glossaire

### 2. Domain model diagram

### 3. Use cases diagrams

### 4. Textual explanation of implemented use cases

### 5. User's events list

### 6. State diagrams of each implemented use case

### 7. TSP sequence diagram

### 8. Classes diagrams
Note: do not _cheat_. We must deliver what we were first thinking about,
not the current classes.

This deliverable comes in two flavors:
* Package diagram (all packages with empty classes + associations)
* Itemized classes diagrams (one for each package), with all public or protect fields
(not the private ones).

### 9. Poject's planning
* Who done what
* Time spent on each task
