# JUnit

## Maven

[Maven](./apache-maven.md) is configured to use it automatically.

## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](./intellij-idea) supports _JUnit_ natively. You can run tests
from their source files or add a run configuration.

## Eclipse

Good news, JUnit is already integrated in Eclipse Neon.1 !
All you have to do is to enable it.

1. Go under `Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Add library` and select
   JUnit.
2. Add a run configuration based on JUnit to run your tests.
3. Congratulations!
