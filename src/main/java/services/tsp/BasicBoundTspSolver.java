     * Bound using the sum of min cost per unseen node (including warehouse) plus the cost of the node. Complexity: O(nÂ²) with n the number
     * of unseen node.
     * Min cost is defined as average of the two min cost (with only one cost per linked node, i.e. the to min cost can't
     * link the two same points, as we know that the next node can't be the same the previous)
     * A one day malus is added by point that cannot be reached on time.

     * @param lastSeenNode
     *            the last explored node.
     * @param unseen
     *            all nodes not explored yet.
     * @param seenCost
     *            the cost of all explored nodes.
     * @param costs
     *            the cost of the path between each node.
     * @param deliveryDurations
     *            the delivery duration of each node.
     * @return a min bound of the cost to see each unseen node
